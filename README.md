### Data Flow Process
```
Camera Input → Face Detection → Feature Extraction → Storage/Comparison → Result Display
     ↓              ↓               ↓                    ↓                    ↓

## 📊 Similarity Calculation

### Multi-Metric Similarity Approach

The system uses three complementary similarity measures to ensure robust face matching:

#### 1. Cosine Similarity (50% weight)
**Purpose**: Measures angular similarity between feature vectors
- **Strength**: Excellent for high-dimensional data, rotation invariant
- **Use Case**: Primary similarity measure for overall facial characteristics
- **Range**: -1 to 1 (higher values indicate greater similarity)

#### 2. Euclidean Similarity (30% weight)
**Purpose**: Measures direct distance between feature points
- **Strength**: Intuitive distance measure, sensitive to magnitude differences
- **Use Case**: Secondary validation for feature vector proximity
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher values indicate greater similarity)

#### 3. Manhattan Similarity (20% weight)
**Purpose**: Measures sum of absolute differences between features
- **Strength**: Robust to outliers, computationally efficient
- **Use Case**: Tertiary validation for feature consistency
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher values indicate greater similarity)

### Weighted Combination Formula
```
Final Similarity = (Cosine × 0.5) + (Euclidean × 0.3) + (Manhattan × 0.2)
```

### Threshold Decision Making
- **Recognition Threshold**: 0.75 (75% similarity required)
- **High Confidence**: > 0.85 (very likely match)
- **Medium Confidence**: 0.75-0.85 (probable match)
- **No Match**: < 0.75 (insufficient similarity)
